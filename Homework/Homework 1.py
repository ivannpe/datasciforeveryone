# -  In this assignment, I will design my own data-driven research project using the scientific method.

# # Pre-Step: I am generally interested in Social Justice

# # Observation: 
# -  Many social movements are started through social media (Twitter, Facebook)

# # Question: 
# -  Do social movements started through social media gain more traction and build more followers?

# # Theory: 
# -  Social movements are built around people. Social media allows a wider reach to a more diverse pool of people.  By comparing social movements created after the social media age and which gained traction through social media (Dependent Variable) and ones not advertised through social media or that happened before social media platforms existed(Independent Variable), we can decide whether there is a linear causality between social media involvement and the success of social movements. In this new digital age, and the dissemination of information, it would be very likely that social movements of today are more successful, become popular faster, and have more supporters than those pre-social media.
# -  Social Media allows social movements to fluorish
#    -  Because of the faster dissemination of information
#    -  Because of the number of people on different platforms
#    -  Because of algorithms that make popular subjects reach more people
#    -  Because of the easy accessibility to social media platforms

# # Hypothesis
# -  If Social Media has an impact on Social Movements, Social Movements formed since the inception of major platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, will grow at a faster rate, reach more people, and have more supporters.

# # Test
# -  I will look at similar social movements i.e. Women's Suffrage Movement and Women's March, and Black Liberation Movement and #BlackLivesMatter, and compare the time it took the movements to catch onto the population, and the amount of support it was able to get.

# ## The kind of test that would help me test my hypothesis would be:
# -   A treatment and control test, in which the movements started after the inception of social media would be in the treatment group, and those before the inception of social media would be in the control group. 

# ## An example dataset that would allow me to do this is:
# -  I would look at already existing data sets, data visualizations, and ones that I would make my self that scale different social justice movements and compare them to eachother. For example, I could create a data visualization that shows the time it took the Women's suffrage movement to gain traction, form a march (the number of years between first mainstream discussions and the passing of the 19th amendment), and the time it took for one facebook event invitation to a proposed Women's March to reach a the same amount of traction (the time the post was made and the date of the first Women's March)

# ## In the test I would look for [what kinds of patterns] to see if the data are consistent with my hypothesis.
# -  Patterns of linear causality, where it would be evident that, in comparison to social movements before social media, social movements started through social media have larger followings, faster growth, and wider impact.

# # Update theory: If I find that I cannot reject my hypothesis, future further tests to learn more might include:
# -  Different machine learning models that could scale the creation of a social movement through social media and non-social media platforms
# -  Looking at different older and contemporary social movements i.e. Indigenous Resistance , Latinx Movements , Teacher Strikes
# -  Instead of looking at numbers of followers, and scale of time between discussions and an actual movement, look at how fast movements led to legislative change.

# #  In conclusion, are you optimistic that you could reliably, meaningfully, and scientifically answer this question? Why or why not?

# -  I am optimistic that I could reliably, meaningfully, and scientifically answer this question because of the data available for this specific topic and the variable I am comparing, and the quality of the data being used to answer it. I also believe that this question is somewhat straight-forward, and the way I set up my hypothesis would make sure that if something specific is seen in the data, it would either disprove my hypothesis, or lead to the creation of an updated one.
