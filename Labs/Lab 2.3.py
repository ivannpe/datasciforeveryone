# # This lab is about causality.

# -  My name is Ivanna Pena.

# -  In this lab, I worked with: no one else

# -  In this first section, I will provide original, real world examples of the following:

# ## An example of linear causality:

# -  Pressing the power button, will turn on your device

# -  This is linear causality because: Pressing the power button is what causes the device to turn on

# ## An example of domino causality is:

# -  Studying for your exam, will lead to a good grade in the exam, which will lead to a better grade in the class, which will lead to a higher GPA

# - This is domino causality because: Studying creates a chain reaction that causes each condition leading to a higher GPA

# ## An example of endogeneous causality is:

# -  Stable family life leads to happiness

# -  This is endogeneous causality because: Stable family life can lead to happiness but happiness can also lead to a stable family life

# ## An example of cyclic causality is:

# -  Getting sick will lead to you being stressed, which will lead to lack of sleep which will lead to you getting sick

# -  This is cyclic causality because: getting sick will cause other factors for you to continue being sick, staying in a cycle

# ## An example of relational causality is:
# 

# -  Wealth and Emotional Support lead to a happy life

# -  This is a relational causality because: two different factors Wealth and Emotional Support lead to the third outcome of a happy life

# # I will now give examples of the following kinds of causal conditions:

# ## An X that is necessary but not sufficient for Y:

# -  Breathing underwater is a necesary but not sufficient condition for living in the ocean.

# ## An X that is sufficient but not necessary for Y:

# -  Studying for an exam is a sufficient but not necessary condition for passing it.

# ## An X that is both necessary and sufficient for Y:

# -  Wealth is both necessary and sufficient for buying a multi-million dollar home.

# ## An X that is neither necessary nor sufficient for Y:

# -  Wealth is neither necessary nor sufficient for happiness

# In conclusion, I will remember to shut off the server when I am finished.
