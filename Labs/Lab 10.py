# -  My name is Ivanna Pena
# -  In this lab I will identify 4 kinds of sample bias in a data-driven article

# # Article

# I chose the Article "What Americans Know About Science : Science knowledge levels remain strongly tied to education; Republicans and Democrats are about equally knowledgeable" By Brian Kennedy and Meg Hefferon from the Pew Research Center.
# 
# www.pewresearch.org/science/2019/03/28/what-americans-know-about-science/
# 
# It is trying to make conclusions about what American populations know about science, its connection to education levels, and the importance of science knowledge in society.

# I chose this article because it has data it is drawing conclusions from, and the title says what "Americans" know about science, and I doubt that every American participated in however they collected this data.

# I like this article, because although some of its phrasing might be meant to put down communities of color due to their inability to answer certain questions, it just reveals a deeper truth about education disparities and access to information for marginalized communities.

# # Selection Bias

# The data for this article was collected through "The American Trends Panel,created by Pew Research Center, a nationally representative panel of randomly selected U.S. adults."
# 29,114 were invited through the web or a landline phone, and 13,569 remain. 
# 
# Although it attempts to get even amounts of underrepresented populations, 2,891 are white, while only 718 are Hispanic and 506 are Black. 
# 
# Regardless of precautions and measures, there are just less people of color participating, which means the distrubution of their answers will be weighed differently. I dont think it is entirely fair to state "whites generally score higher than blacks and Hispanics" when the number of scores for white outnumber those of blacks and hispanics together by more than 1,000.

# # Response Bias

# There is no information from the Pew Research center thats tells anything about how people fill out these surveys, and what they have access to while they take it. If there is no one monitoring the survey, I am sure there might have been cheating involved by people to had access to other devices or things that could provide these answers for them, meanwhile those without access to more information, had to answer on the spot based on their own knowledge.
# 
# I consider this response bias because, people want to feel smarter, they want others to think they are smart, and not having control over how people take surveys, or not knowing whether or not they had access to outside information to help them with their answers for the survey presents a bias in the data.
# 
# This can greatly affect the outcomes of those who do not have access to outside information, and lead to incorrect conclusions about the amount of knowledge of anyone tested.

# # Information Bias

# It is also not said how the answers are collected or determined to be correct. I know even in this class there have been times in the past with the surveys that I would answer a question correctly, but be marked wrong for the way I typed it, phrased the answer, or just syntax. 
# 
# It is possible that some people answered correctly, but the way in which the answers were colelcted and graded could've marked them wrong.
# 
# This can affect the percentage correct of some of these answers, and change the margin of error for different populations and variables being used to draw conclusions

# # Invisibility Bias

# This survey excludes other minority populations that are not Black or Hispanic, and also excludes those who dont fit into the gender- binary or are gender non-conforming. 
# 
# This is invisibility bias because it is not including these populations due to lack of their relevance, lack of access to them, or not even thinking about reaching out to them in the selection process.
# 
# This greatly impacts the conclusions made by this article, because it claims to speak for "Americans" when clearly the American population is not acurrately represented in the sample, and whole chunks of the American population that are crucial to our national identity are entirely excluded.

# # Conclusion

# Based on my assesment above, I'm not entirely confident in the conclusions made by this article because of the fact that so many people are missing and people are underrepresented in the data which leads to inaccurate, or misleading data.
# 
# I think what is most problematic is how conclusions are being made about populations, regardless of the fact that they are unevenly represented and how these conclusions might in turn be twisted by people to generalize entire populations, something that this article already seems to be doing.
# 
# If I had the resources to conduct a better study, I would collect the data from various different races, ethnicities, gender identities that fall between different economic and education levels, and make sure that the survey is given in a controlled environment, and that each population is given the same amount of voices in the survey and same environment to take it in. Most importantly though, regardless of how representative my sample is of the American population, I will make sure that in the reporting of my findings, I make it clear who and how many people participated, and that these conclusions don't represent everyone in those categories, or America as a whole as much as I would've perhaps wished it did.
